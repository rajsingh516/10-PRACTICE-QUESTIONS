    <h2>HTML:-</h2>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. 
      It forms the structural foundation of almost all content displayed on the World Wide Web.Key characteristics of HTML include:
      Markup Language:
      HTML uses a system of "tags" and "elements" to define the structure and content of a web page. These tags enclose and describe different 
      parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists.
      Hypertext:
      The "HyperText" in HTML refers to its ability to link different web pages together using hyperlinks. This allows users to navigate 
      seamlessly between related content on the web.
      Structure:
      HTML primarily focuses on the structural organization of content. It dictates the hierarchy and arrangement of elements, enabling web 
      browsers to interpret and display the content as intended.
      Foundation of Web Development:
      While HTML provides the structure, it is often combined with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity 
      to create dynamic and visually appealing web experiences.</p>

    <h2>CSS:-</h2>
    <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a 
      markup language like HTML. It is a fundamental technology for web design, working alongside HTML (which provides the structure of a 
      webpage) and JavaScript (which adds interactivity).The primary purpose of CSS is to separate the content and structure of a document 
      (defined by HTML) from its visual presentation. This separation offers several advantages:
      Improved Maintainability:
      Styles can be defined in a single CSS file and applied across multiple web pages, allowing for global style changes with a single 
      modification.
      Enhanced Design Control:
      CSS provides a wide range of properties to control the appearance of elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and positioning.
      Faster Loading Times:
      By separating styles, HTML files become smaller and load quicker, as styling information is handled externally.
      Accessibility:
      CSS allows for different stylesheets to be applied based on the user's device or preferences, improving accessibility for various users 
      and devices.</p>

  <section id="js">
    <h2>JavaScript:-</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language primarily known for 
      enabling interactive and dynamic content on web pages.It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
      Key aspects of JavaScript include:
      Client-side Scripting:
      Its most common use is in web browsers, where it runs on the client's machine to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user 
      interactions, validate forms, create animations, and update content dynamically without requiring a full page reload.
      Server-side Development:
      With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming, allowing developers to build full-stack applications
      using a single language.
      Versatility:
      Beyond web development, JavaScript is also used in various other domains, including mobile app development (e.g., React Native), desktop 
      applications (e.g., Electron), game development, and even embedded systems.
      Dynamic and Flexible:
      JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
      including imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming.</p>
